# DOTFILES

There is an install script for Homebrew, `brew.sh` that will install Homebrew, update, upgrade any pre-installed packeages and the install my homebrew formulae

The rest of the files and configs are here for reference more or less.

If you stumble across this repo, __USE AT YOUR OWN RISK__

Most of this won't get used in any real way, but is here for me to set up new macbooks
