[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    This command is used to deploy both code and configuration to the App
    Engine server. As an input it takes one or more [1m[1;4mDEPLOYABLES[1m[m that should be
    uploaded. A [1m[1;4mDEPLOYABLE[1m[m can be a service's .yaml file or a configuration's
    .yaml file (for more information about configuration files specific to your
    App Engine environment, refer to
    https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/configuration-files
    or
    https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/configuration-files).
    Note, for Java8 Standard apps or Java11 Standard apps using bundled
    services, you must add the path to the [1mappengine-web.xml[m file inside the
    WEB-INF directory. gcloud app deploy skips files specified in the
    .gcloudignore file (see [1mgcloud topic gcloudignore[m for more information).
    For Java11 Standard, you can either use the yaml file, a Maven pom.xml, or
    a Gradle build.gradle. Alternatively, if the application is a single
    self-contained jar, you can give the path to the jar and a simple service
    configuration will be generated. You can deploy Java11 Maven source
    projects by specifying the location of your project's pom.xml file, and it
    will be built and deployed using App Engine Buildpacks.

[m[1mEXAMPLES[m
    To deploy a single service, run:

        $ gcloud app deploy ~/my_app/app.yaml

    To deploy an App Engine Standard Java8 service or a Java11 service using
    bundled services, run:

        $ gcloud app deploy ~/my_app/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml

    To deploy an App Engine Standard Java11 single jar, run:

        $ gcloud app deploy ~/my_app/my_jar.jar

    To deploy an App Engine Standard Java11 Maven source project, run:

        $ gcloud app deploy ~/my_app/pom.xml

    To deploy an App Engine Standard Java11 Gradle source project, run:

        $ gcloud app deploy ~/my_app/build.gradle

    By default, the service is deployed to the current project configured via:

        $ gcloud config set core/project PROJECT

    To override this value for a single deployment, use the [1m[1;4m--project[1m[m flag:

        $ gcloud app deploy ~/my_app/app.yaml --project=PROJECT

    To deploy multiple services, run:

        $ gcloud app deploy ~/my_app/app.yaml ~/my_app/another_service.yaml

    To change the default --promote behavior for your current environment, run:

        $ gcloud config set app/promote_by_default false

[m[1mPOSITIONAL ARGUMENTS[m
     [[4mDEPLOYABLES[m ...]
        The yaml files for the services or configurations you want to deploy.
        If not given, defaults to [1mapp.yaml[m in the current directory. If that is
        not found, attempts to automatically generate necessary configuration
        files (such as app.yaml) in the current directory.

[m[1mFLAGS[m
     [1m--appyaml[m=[4mAPPYAML[m
        Deploy with a specific app.yaml that will replace the one defined in
        the DEPLOYABLE.

     [1m--bucket[m=[4mBUCKET[m
        The Google Cloud Storage bucket used to stage files associated with the
        deployment. If this argument is not specified, the application's
        default code bucket is used.

     [1m--cache[m
        Skip caching mechanisms involved in the deployment process, in
        particular do not use cached dependencies during the build step.
        Enabled by default, use [1m--no-cache[m to disable.

     [1m--ignore-file[m=[4mIGNORE_FILE[m
        Override the .gcloudignore file and use the specified file instead.

     [1m--image-url[m=[4mIMAGE_URL[m
        (App Engine flexible environment only.) Deploy with a specific Docker
        image. Docker url must be from one of the valid Container Registry
        hostnames.

     [1m--promote[m
        Promote the deployed version to receive all traffic. Overrides the
        default [1mapp/promote_by_default[m property value for this command
        invocation. Use [1m--no-promote[m to disable.

     [1m--stop-previous-version[m
        Stop the previously running version when deploying a new version that
        receives all traffic.

        Note that if the version is running on an instance of an auto-scaled
        service in the App Engine Standard environment, using
        [1m--stop-previous-version[m will not work and the previous version will
        continue to run because auto-scaled service instances are always
        running.

        Overrides the default [1mapp/stop_previous_version[m property value for this
        command invocation. Use [1m--no-stop-previous-version[m to disable.

     [1m--version[m=[4mVERSION[m, [1m-v[m [4mVERSION[m
        The version of the app that will be created or replaced by this
        deployment. If you do not specify a version, one will be generated for
        you.

[m[1mGCLOUD WIDE FLAGS[m
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run [1m$ gcloud help[m for details.
