    gcloud app - manage your App Engine deployments

[m[1mSYNOPSIS[m
    [1mgcloud app[m [4mGROUP[m | [4mCOMMAND[m [[4mGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...[m]

[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    The gcloud app command group lets you deploy and manage your Google App
    Engine apps. These commands replace their equivalents in the appcfg tool.

    App Engine is a platform for building scalable web applications and mobile
    backends. App Engine provides you with built-in services and APIs such as
    NoSQL datastores, memcache, and a user authentication API, common to most
    applications.

    More information on App Engine can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/appengine and detailed documentation can be found
    here: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/

[m[1mEXAMPLES[m
    To run your app locally in the development application server to simulate
    your application running in production App Engine with sandbox restrictions
    and services provided by App Engine SDK libraries, use the [1mdev_appserver.py[m
    command and your app's [1mapp.yaml[m configuration file to run:

        $ dev_appserver.py ~/my_app/app.yaml

    For an in-depth look into using the local development server, follow this
    guide :
    https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/tools/using-local-server

    To deploy the code and configuration of your app to the App Engine server,
    run:

        $ gcloud app deploy ~/my_app/app.yaml

    To list all versions of all services of your existing deployments, run:

        $ gcloud app versions list
